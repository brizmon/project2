## Future improvements
My initial concept of making a designer assistant app could not be possible due to several complications I had with the APIs I chose. Some improvements I could work on are:
- To display the style of the font, as of now all fonts have the same typeface which defeats the purpose of the app, because the user is supposed to see how the font looks like

- A search feature where the user can browse fonts based on filters like font family, category, style and variants.

This project was very difficult for me to complete, but in the end it was a great learning experience. Even though I did not get the result I had planed, I learnt that this is a learning process and I should be patient and of course keep on practicing and learning to better myself as a developer.
